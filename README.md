# Klimatkalendern

Klimatkalendern is an event calendar for all activities in Sweden (or elsewhere)
that aims to promote sustainablility.

This git repo is a detached Mobilizon fork repurposed to serve klimatkalendern.nu.
The fork diverges from Mobilizon 5.1.2 with changes tailored to our specific use case.
As a consequence, this project is currently of limited use outside klimatkalendern.nu.

This README contains instructions for setting up the project locally,
if you want to know more about Klimatkalendern, visit
[klimatkalendern.nu](https://klimatkalendern.nu).

Contributors are much welcome, we could use extra eyes on this.
If you want to restore a state for testing and development, but don't have access
to our storage, email us at info@klimatkalendern.nu.

## Setup
Ensure you have a machine running either linux, macOS or wsl with git installed, then:

**Clone this repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kompismoln/klimatkalendern
    cd klimatkalendern
    ```

### Install Nix

Nix is used to manage the build and deployment pipeline.
Although not strictly necessary for development, it's highly recommended.
Nix ensures all system dependencies have the correct versions and enables you to test
the production build process, verifying it will work as expected.
If you don't want to use nix for some reason, all system dependencies are specified
in `flake.nix` under `devShell`.

1.  **Install Nix with flake support:**

    We recommend the lix.systems implementation as it allows flakes to be enabled during install.

    Follow the instructions on their respective websites.
    * Nix: [https://nixos.org/download.html](https://nixos.org/download.html)
    * Lix: [https://lix.systems/](https://lix.systems/)

2.  **Enter Development Environment:**

    Within the cloned repository, run:
    ```bash
    nix develop
    ```
    This command sets up an environment with all the necessary dependencies.

    *Note on `nix develop` vs `nix-direnv`*:
    Using `nix develop` works, but it's not always convenient as you'll need to exit and re-enter
    the shell when switching branches or if `flake.nix` is updated.
    To ensure that the environment is automatically updated when you `cd` into the
    project directory, consider using [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv).
    Follow its installation instructions to set it up.

### Configure the mobilizon instance

This step will generate `config/runtime.exs` which is used to configure
the local mobilizon instance.

First run:
```
mix mobilizon.instance gen
```

Then answer the following for the questions prompted:
```
What domain will your instance use? (e.g mobilizon.org) []  localhost
What is the name of your instance? (e.g. Mobilizon) []  klimatkalendern
What's the address email will be send with? [noreply@localhost]
What is the hostname of your database? [localhost]
What is the name of your database? [mobilizon_prod]  mobilizon_dev
What is the user used to connect to your database? [mobilizon]
What is the password used to connect to your database? [autogenerated]  mobilizon
What port will the app listen to (leave it if you are using the default setup with nginx)? [4000]
```

### Install and configure Postgres

You'll need a PostgreSQL database with the PostGIS extension.
This setup assumes PostgreSQL is managed at the OS level.

**1. Install PostgreSQL and PostGIS:**

* **For Debian-based Linux:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib postgis
    # On some systems, PostGIS might be versioned, e.g., postgresql-15-postgis-3
    # You may also need client libraries: sudo apt install libpq-dev
    ```
    PostgreSQL service usually starts automatically after installation.

* **For NixOS:**

    Add this to you system configuration:
    ```nix
    config.services.postgresql = {
      extensions =
        ps: with ps; [
          postgis
          pg_repack
        ];
      enable = true;
      package = pkgs.postgresql_15;
    };

    ```
* **For macOS (using Homebrew):**

    If you don't have Homebrew, install it first from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh).
    ```bash
    brew install postgresql@15 # Or your preferred supported version, e.g., postgresql@16
    brew install postgis

    # To have launchd start postgresql now and restart at login:
    brew services start postgresql@15
    # Or, if you don't want/need a background service, you can manage it manually:
    # pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start # (path might vary based on version)
    ```
    *Note: Homebrew might install a specific version (e.g., `postgresql@15`).
    Ensure your `PATH` is updated as per Homebrew's instructions if you install a versioned formula,
    or link it.*

**2. Initial Postgres User and Database Setup:**

Access `psql` as a PostgreSQL administrative user.

* **On Linux:**
    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres psql
    ```
* **On macOS:**
    Depending on your installation (especially with Homebrew), you might be able to run
    `psql postgres` directly. If not, try:
    ```bash
    psql -U postgres -d template1 # Or your macOS username if you initialized the cluster as such
    ```

Now, within the `psql` prompt, create the `mobilizon` user and `mobilizon_dev` database:
```sql
CREATE USER mobilizon WITH PASSWORD 'mobilizon';
CREATE DATABASE mobilizon_dev OWNER mobilizon;

-- Connect to the new database to enable extensions within it
\c mobilizon_dev;

-- Enable necessary extensions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS unaccent;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;

-- You can verify extensions with \dx
-- Exit psql
\q
```
**3. Setup database**

If you are not restoring state, create empty tables and add an admin user:
```
mix ecto.migrate
mix mobilizon.users.new john.doe@localhost.com --admin
```
Otherwise, download desired database dump (dump-localhost-YYYYMMDD.sql).
Then, import it into mobilizon_dev (ensure you are not inside the psql console for this command;
run it from your regular terminal shell):
```bash
psql -h localhost -U mobilizon -d mobilizon_dev < path/to/your/downloaded/dbdump.sql
```

Make sure to replace path/to/your/downloaded/dbdump.sql with the actual path to the dump
file you downloaded.

Download user-uploaded media files that match the database dump.
Unzip this archive into an `./uploads` directory at the root of the cloned project.


**4. Verify Database Setup:**

Connect to the database as the mobilizon user and check that tables exist:
```bash
psql -h localhost -U mobilizon -d mobilizon_dev
```

Inside psql, run:
```sql
\dt
```

You should see a list of tables. Exit with `\q`.

The database is now installed and configured.

### Install and compile Elixir dependencies
Ensure you are inside the Nix development shell (`nix develop` or via direnv).

Install Elixir Dependencies:
```bash
mix deps.get
```

If prompted to install `rebar3`, answer y (yes).

**Compile the Application:**
According to upstream documentation, some commands are run with `MIX_ENV=prod`
the reason for this is unkown, we just do it because they do it.

```bash
MIX_ENV=prod mix compile
```

### Install and Build Frontend Assets:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
MIX_ENV=prod mix phx.digest
```

Run the Phoenix Server:
```bash
mix phx.server
```

Klimatkalendern should now be available at http://localhost:4000.

Check upstream documentation for more info: https://docs.mobilizon.org/4.%20Contribute/development/

## Resetting Your Environment
If you encounter issues, want to apply a fresh database dump, or need to start with a clean slate,
you can reset your environment.

Warning: This process will delete your local mobilizon_dev database, compiled code,
and local dependencies.

**Stop the Phoenix Server:**

If mix phx.server is running, stop it (usually Ctrl+C twice in the terminal).

**Clean Project Artifacts:**

Ensure you are in the project's root directory.
```bash
# Clean Elixir build artifacts and compiled dependencies
mix clean
mix deps.clean --all

# Clean frontend dependencies and build artifacts
rm config/runtime.exs
rm -rf node_modules/
rm -rf priv/static/assets
```

**Reset Database:**

Connect to psql as a PostgreSQL superuser (e.g., postgres on Linux, or your admin user on macOS):

Linux:
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```
macOS:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d template1 (or similar, see setup)
```

Then execute the following SQL commands:
```sql
-- Terminate any active connections to mobilizon_dev before dropping
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'mobilizon_dev';
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS mobilizon_dev;
DROP USER IF EXISTS mobilizon;
```

Exit psql (type `\q` and press Enter).

**Nix Environment Refresh:**

If you are using nix develop directly, exit the shell and re-enter it.
If using direnv, you can run `direnv reload` or `touch flake.nix`.
in the project directory to force a refresh of the environment.

Your environment is now reset and you can follow the setup guide from
step 2 under Postgresql ("Initial Postgres User and Database setup").
